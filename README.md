# personalWebsiteInfra
AWS infrastructure for personal website based on AWS S3 static website hosting see https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website
Also it is empowered by Codepipeline to not setup website source manually

The main idea was to make reusable AWS infrastructure able to launch static website
During working on the script I faced the issue with SSL certificates validation which requires manual processing

After certificate is issued, the ownership of the domain it was issued for must be validated either by 
email see (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html) or by DNS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html) method

Because of GDPR most registrars dont display email addressed via WHOIS, so the best way to validate certificate is DNS method, which requires configured NSes on the registrar side, which means zone must be created on AWS

Because I did not find any way to brake terraform setup into several apply stages. I decided to split up the infra myself on several stages

1. Create Website bucket & Code pipeline
2. Create hosted zone + print NSs to setup
Here NSs must be set to your domain registrar before you proceed
3. Issuing SSL certificate and waiting till the validation succeed
4. Setup the rest of the site components CDN, DNS records

Maybe it is not the best brake down for the systems where hosted zones and certificates are already set up, but for small websites it can be the most conveniant way

To make it reusable I made common variable and configuration files
    - backend_config.tfvars - Contains all the parameters of S3 backend
    - terraform.tfvars - Contains all the parameters of the website setup

To install the website, you need to review and update both backend_config.tfvars and terraform.tfvars and then enter to each directory, starting from 01_WebSiteBucket

and enter:

    terraform init -backend-config="../backend_config.tfvars"

        To configure terraform backend and then

    terraform apply -var-file="../terraform.tfvars"

        To apply the setup


    The modules dependencies are following:

    01_WebSiteBucket is independent, can be applied at any moment
    02_Zone is independent
    03_Certificate depends on 02_Zone, because hosted zone must be created prior to certificate validation
    04_ContentDistribution depends on 01_WebSiteBucket, 02_Zone and 03_Certificate
